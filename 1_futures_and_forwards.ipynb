    "\n",
    "**Introduction to Financial Derivatives**\n",
    "- Financial derivatives are contracts derived from another asset or instrument.\n",
    "- Used for risk management and speculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Derivatives**\n",
    "- Includes futures contracts, options contracts, swaps, and forwards.\n",
    "- Categorized by the relationship with the underlying asset, type of asset, and market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of Derivatives**\n",
    "- Two primary purposes: speculation and hedging.\n",
    "- Speculators aim to profit from price movements.\n",
    "- Hedgers use derivatives to reduce existing risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types of Underlying Assets**\n",
    "- Common assets include equities (stocks), fixed income (bonds), commodities, indices, forex, and non-traditional assets like weather events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Market Participants**\n",
    "- Participants: hedgers, speculators, arbitrageurs, and middlemen.\n",
    "- Hedgers are producers or consumers managing exposure.\n",
    "- Speculators seek profit.\n",
    "- Arbitrageurs exploit price differences.\n",
    "- Middlemen facilitate trades for a commission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arbitrage**\n",
    "- Profiting from price differences in identical or similar instruments in different markets.\n",
    "- Maintains prices close to fair value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Derivative Market Dynamics**\n",
    "- Middlemen profit from high market activity through commissions or spreads.\n",
    "- They hedge residual exposures to avoid significant profits or losses."

    "\n",
    "**How Derivatives are Traded**\n",
    "- Two groups of derivatives: Over-the-Counter (OTC) and Exchange-Traded Derivatives.\n",
    "- OTC derivatives are traded directly between two parties, subject to counterparty risk.\n",
    "- OTC market primarily involves banks, large corporations, and sophisticated parties.\n",
    "- Push to bring OTC derivatives onto clearing platforms for financial stability.\n",
    "- Exchange-traded derivatives are traded via specialized derivatives exchanges.\n",
    "- Exchanges act as intermediaries, taking margin payments for guarantee.\n",
    "- Most exchange-traded derivatives are traded electronically through brokers or investment banks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Major Derivative Contract Types**\n",
    "- The most common derivative contracts are:\n",
    "  - **Forwards**: OTC contracts for future payment at a predetermined price.\n",
    "  - **Futures**: Exchange-listed contracts for buying or selling assets on a future date at a specified price.\n",
    "  - **Options**: Contracts that grant the buyer the right (but not the obligation) to transact at a predetermined price.\n",
    "  - **Warrants**: Similar to call options, often issued by companies on their own stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clarification on Derivatives as Contracts**\n",
    "- All derivatives are considered legal contracts between two parties.\n",
    "- They do not represent ownership of underlying assets but rather contracts with payoffs based on the underlying's price.\n",
    "- Derivatives markets are often misunderstood as legalized gambling, but they serve essential economic functions.\n",
    "- They allow for risk allocation, stimulate the economy, and improve market efficiency.\n",
    "- Derivatives can lead to large losses, primarily due to excessive leverage."

    "- Private agreements: Typically traded over-the-counter (OTC) rather than on exchanges.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Parties can agree on various aspects, such as quantity, price, and delivery date.\n",
    "- Settlement: Often settled in cash but can involve physical delivery.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Terms in Forward Contracts**\n",
    "- **Underlying Asset**: The asset being bought or sold in the contract (e.g., currency, commodity).\n",

    "- In finance, being \"long\" means owning an asset.\n",
    "- Being \"short\" involves borrowing the asset and selling it, intending to buy it back later.\n",
    "- **Long position**: Profit when the asset price rises, losses when it falls, linear relationship. \n",
    "  - Profits are unlimited as asset prices can rise indefinitely.\n",
    "  - Losses are limited, as prices cannot go below zero.\n",
    "- **Short position:** Profit when the asset price falls, losses when it rises, linear relationship.\n",
    "  - Gains are capped when asset prices fall to zero.\n",
    "  - Losses are unlimited as prices can keep rising.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Futures and Forwards Payoff Diagrams**\n",
    "- Payoff profiles for futures and forwards are nearly identical to those for being long or short the underlying asset.\n",
    "- Investors enter at the futures price and the ultimate payoff depends on the final futures price (expiration or contract closure).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Backwardation:**\n",
    "- Backwardation is a market situation where <span style=\"color:blue\">the futures price of a commodity is less than the expected future spot price of that commodity at the contract's maturity</span>.\n",
    "- This condition suggests that the futures market is pricing the commodity at a discount compared to the expected future market price.\n",
    "- Backwardation typically occurs when there is a strong demand for the commodity in the present, and this demand drives up its spot price, making it higher than the futures price.\n",
    "- It is often associated with commodities that are in short supply or facing immediate delivery constraints.\n",
    "- For hedgers, backwardation can be favorable as it allows them to lock in a sale price for their commodity that is higher than the current futures price.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contango**\n",
    "- Contango, on the other hand, is a market condition where <span style=\"color:blue\">the futures price of a commodity is higher than the expected future spot price at the contract's maturity</span>.\n",
    "- In contango, the futures market prices the commodity at a premium compared to the expected future market price.\n",
    "- Contango is often driven by factors like storage costs, financing costs, or expectations of oversupply in the future.\n",
    "- For commodities with carrying costs (like storage, insurance, and financing), it is common for futures prices to be higher than spot prices.\n",
    "- Speculators who are long in a contango market may face the challenge of holding the commodity at higher costs.\n",
    "\n",

    "**Why Companies Hedge**\n",
    "- Companies may lack expertise in predicting market prices, such as interest rates, exchange rates, and commodity prices.\n",

    "- It allows companies to focus on their core expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Counterargument: Individual Shareholder Hedging**\n",
    "- Some argue that shareholders can hedge market exposures individually.\n",
    "- Companies shouldn't hedge because investors may have specific reasons for investing (e.g., in a gold mining company) and may not want their gains affected by hedging.\n",
    "- It is more cost-effective to do it at a company level due to \"size discounts\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hedging for Visibility and Planning**\n",
    "- Companies that hedge gain visibility into future prices.\n",
    "- It aids in making long-term projections and business plans with stable profit margins.\n",

    "#### 1 - Show that the minimum variance hedge ratio ($h$) when trying cross-hedge a portfolio's volatility using overall market Futures is equal to $\\beta$\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to remember, the minimum variance hedge ratio ($h$) has the following form: \n",
    "$$h =  \\frac{\\rho_{E,F} \\ \\sigma_{E}}{\\sigma_{F}}$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "where \n",
    "* $E$ refers to the asset we are exposed to (e.g., a variety of oil, a stock portfolio, etc.), \n",
    "* $F$ refers to the asset we want to use its futures to hedge with (e.g., a different variety of oil whose futures are more liquid, the futures of the overall market, etc.), \n",
    "* $\\rho_{E,F}$ is the Pearson correlation between $E$ and $F$\n",
    "* $\\sigma$ is the standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the formula for Pearson's correlation is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\rho_{E,F} = \\frac{\\text{cov(E, F)}}{\\sigma_{E}\\sigma_{F}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we expand $h$ using this information we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ h = \\frac{\\text{cov(E, F)}\\sigma_{E}}{\\sigma_{E}\\sigma_{F}\\sigma_{F}} = \\frac{\\text{cov(E, F)}}{\\sigma_{F}^{2}}$$\n",

    "#### 2 - You manage a stock portfolio worth 100 million dollars. The portfolio has a $\\beta$ of 1.1. Explain how would you fully hedge this portfolio if the SP500 futures contract is currently trading at 2000\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, first we need to remember that the formula of $\\beta$ is as follows: $\\frac{\\text{cov(E, F)}}{\\sigma_{F}^{2}}$ and that the number of futures contracts that we need to fully hedge our portfolio comes from the following formula: $ N = \\frac{\\beta \\ V_{E}}{V_{F}} $.\n",

    "#### 3 - An automanufacturing executive argues that there is no point to the company using metals futures. There is an equal chance that the price of input metals in the future will be less than the futures price as there is that the they will be greater than this price. Discuss the pros and cons of the executive's opinion.\n",
